Hybrid & Pure GNN Fraud Detection

Project Overview
This project implements financial fraud detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on two datasets:

Datasets
Both datasets are Kaggle datasets, with links below
1. Paysim datasets - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1
2. Credit Card datasets - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Credit Card Dataset (CCD)

Pure GNN models: GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE
Hybrid GNN + symbolic rules



PaySim Dataset (synthetic mobile transactions)

Pure GNN models: GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE
Hybrid GNN + symbolic rules



Real-Time Demo

Kafka-based streaming simulation
Streamlit dashboard with live fraud scores and fraud rings
Uses hybrid GNN + symbolic rules on PaySim transactions
