# Hybrid-Pure-GNN-Fraud-Detection
Msc Final project on the use of GNN model along with Symbolic ai, particularly in the use of financial fraud detection. 

Project Overview
This project implements financial fraud detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on two datasets:


Credit Card Dataset (CCD)

Pure GNN models: GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE
Hybrid GNN + symbolic rules



PaySim Dataset (synthetic mobile transactions)

Pure GNN models: GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE
Hybrid GNN + symbolic rules



Real-Time Demo

Kafka-based streaming simulation
Streamlit dashboard with live fraud scores and fraud rings
Uses hybrid GNN + symbolic rules on PaySim transactions




Brief Outline of proj :

Dataset - contains both datasets
Demo w - contains datasets preparation, model and full end to end demo system for demo
EDA datasets - contains EDA files for both datasets
GNN models for Credit Card dataset - Pure GNN model and Symbolic GNN model (hybrid)
GNN models for Paysim - Pure GNN model and Symbolic GNN model (hybrid)
